	# print("Subset of (A, C, D) among the Emergent Compounds: ")
	# for compound in subset[0]: print("\t", compound)

	# # compounds:
	# subset_mat = ground_truth.is_subset([("A", "C", "D"), ("B", "E"), ("C",)], [("A", "B", "C", "D"), ("B", "D", "E")])
	# print("Subset relationship bewteen [(A, C, D), (B, E), (C,)] and [(A, B, C, D), (B, D, E)]: ")
